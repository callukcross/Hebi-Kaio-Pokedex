// This folder contains the majority of the project and the GUI, including the majority of any code needed to run and interact
with the project.
// The Properties folder inside the GUI folder was manually added- the project will NOT work without it- leave it alone.
// WindowTemplate is the main form template for the application. It is everything needed to run the GUI and work on coding ready
to go. When creating a new form (new window, new screen, or new page for the GUI), copy and paste this folder in the File Explorer
and follow these instructions:
	* Rename the folder to the name of the new form.
	* Rename the WindowTemplate.cs file to the name of the new form (name.cs)
	* Rename the WindowTemplate.Designer.cs file to the name of the new form (name.Designer.cs)
	* Rename the WindowTemplate.resx file to the name of the new form (name.resx)
		* Do NOT rename any other files in the folder.
	* Open the .cs file and change the class name to the name of the new form
		* public partial class WindowTemplate : Form -> public partial class NewFormName : Form
		  public WindowTemplate() -> public NewFormName()
	* Open the .Designer.cs file and change the class name to the name of the new form
		* partial class WindowTemplate -> partial class NewFormName
	* Open the GUI.csproj file and replace all instances of "WindowTemplate" with the name of the new form
		* There are 5 instances.
	* Open the Program.cs file and replace the instance of "WindowTemplate" with the name of the new form
		* Applciation.Run(new WindowTemplate()); -> Application.Run(new NewFormName());
	* To see if done correctly, open the GUI.sln file in the folder, then double click WindowTemplate.cs. If done correctly,
	it will open the GUI for editing, and if you run the program you should encounter no errors.
