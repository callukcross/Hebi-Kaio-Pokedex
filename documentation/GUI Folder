// This folder contains the majority of the project and the GUI, including the majority of any code needed to run and interact
with the project.
// The Properties folder inside the GUI folder was manually added- the project will NOT work without it- leave it alone.
// MainMenu1 is the Main Menu screen where the app will always load to on startup.
